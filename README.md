# st - suckless terminal

My build of st, with focus on productivity and keyboard-driven workflow.

## Features

- transparency (need a third-party compositor)
- select URL to open with alt+l
- scroll with alt + {j, k, u, d}
- zoom with alt+shift+ {j, k} or ctrl+ {-, =}
- reset zoom with ctrl+shift+ =
- insert arbitrary Unicode character with ctrl+shift+u
- synchronized rendering support
- fallback fonts
- spawn a new terminal in the same directory with ctrl+shift+return
